# Reinforcement Learning Agent - Medical Hospital :man_scientist:

## Overview :medical_symbol:

This is a reinforcement learning project aimed at optimizing a simulated mission-based environment. The goal is to train an agent using Keras, Keras-RL, and Gym to navigate a custom environment. The example environment is a 5x5 grid representing a hospital where the agent must reach a medicine cabinet while avoiding collisions with doctors and nurses.

## Environment :pill:

The custom environment simulates a 5x5 grid of a hospital. The agent's objective is to navigate from its starting position to the medicine cabinet while avoiding obstacles such as doctors and nurses.
